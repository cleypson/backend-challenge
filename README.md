# Backend Developer Challenge
This is a simple challenge to test your skills on building APIs.
It has to be done using Python and the Django Framework 

# What to do
Create a simple API to manage places (CRUD). This API should allow to:
- Create a place
- Edit a place
- Get a specific place
- List places and filter them by name

A place must have the following fields:
- name

- city
- state
- created at
- updated at

# Requirements
- All API responses must be JSON
- Provide a README.md file with usage instructions (how to run, endpoints etc)
- Provide a testing environment (heroku, docker, etc)

# Recommendations

- SOLID / DRY
- Code and commits in english (methods, classes, variables, etc)

# Evaluation
- Project structure, architecturing and organization
- Programming good practices
- VCS practices

# Delivery
